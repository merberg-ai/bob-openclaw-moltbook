# Bob 💀 — Project TODO

**Last reviewed:** October 29, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles)  
**Canonical repo:** `merberg-ai/bob-openclaw-moltbook`, `main`  
**Operator-tested deployed baseline:** `v0.7.5-fm31-watch1`  
**Status:** Roadmap only. **CH1 not implemented, tested on host, or installed.**  
**Deployment contract:** future implementation through `bobctl update` with verified private backup, installed-module import checks, reversible release and short live acceptance. A Git commit alone never changes the running Activity Manager.

## Current development streams

| Stream | Progress | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personality (PM1) and Memory (PM2) | Implemented / operator-tested | Maintain existing explicit memory recall and owner review boundaries |
| Friends (FM1, FM2, FM3, FM3.1) | Implemented / operator-tested | **FM3.2**, followed by **FM4** (social memory) and **FM5** (independent discovery); see [FM1–FM5 roadmap & fresh-chat handoff](docs/FRIENDS-ROADMAP-AND-HANDOFF.md) |
| Logs & Diagnostics | Installed / operator-tested | Future persistent sanitized startup-failure summaries; journal rotation can erase early import errors |
| **Direct Bob Chat (CH1)** | **Planned here, not started** | Gateway compatibility spike, then authenticated LAN chat UI |
| Fresh-host installer | Deferred | Keep current WSL/Windows startup, services and updater intact |

The earlier Scout `ModuleNotFoundError: bob_publish_common` was repaired through `v0.7.5-scout-importfix1`; the operator installed the shared helper and reset the historical failed status. Separately verify a later **timer-driven complete Scout run** when convenient. Don't restart services simply to satisfy this plan.

## CH1: Talk directly to the real OpenClaw agent Bob

### User story / non-negotiable requirement

> From my phone or laptop on the secure private LAN, open the existing authenticated Bob Activity Manager, select **Chat**, type “Bob, what have you been up to on Moltbook?” or “Which agents interest you and why?”, and converse with **Bob the existing OpenClaw agent** using his personality and available memory. Not an Ollama-only imitation.

**LAN access is a hard requirement.** The chat must work via the same trusted-LAN Activity Manager URL and login already used on the OMEN (previously tested at `http://192.168.1.24:18790`), without visiting the OpenClaw Gateway UI separately, connecting a browser to Gateway port `18789`, exposing new Windows inbound ports or requiring internet/public hosting. Test from a second LAN device and Android/mobile browser.

**Hard boundary:** direct interaction with the OpenClaw agent **does not** confer extra rights to publish, DM, follow, vote, execute commands or modify settings. Effective OpenClaw tools/profile and existing Moltbook host-only publisher authorization must remain in charge; the dashboard cannot silently convert a chat message into a publication job.

### Proposed architecture

```text
Trusted LAN browser (phone or laptop)
  │
  │ same origin + existing Activity Manager authentication
  │ HTTPS recommended for production (protect password and chat text)
  ▼
Bob Activity Manager   [WSL2; LAN-accessible existing port 18790]
  /chat  : mobile-first, authenticated UI
  /api/chat/* : exact bounded history/send/status/abort handlers
  │
  │ server-side, authenticated, strictly allowlisted chat adapter
  │ single configured Bob agent/session, origin/CSRF/rate checks
  │ no browser-visible Gateway credentials, no arbitrary RPC proxy
  ▼
OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket [127.0.0.1:18789, loopback ONLY]
  │ current, correctly paired/authenticated operator client
  │ chat.history / chat.send / chat.abort and necessary events
  ▼
Existing OpenClaw agent: Bob 💀
  configured SOUL.md / IDENTITY.md, agent workspace & model
  local Ollama qwen3.5:9b as configured provider
```

**LAN feasibility:** already solved at the Activity Manager boundary. The backend is the only Gateway client. **Do not change `gateway.bind` from loopback to LAN**, add a wildcard listener for Gateway, pipe a Gateway token into HTML/JS, embed the privileged Control UI in an iframe, or implement a general WebSocket forward proxy.

OpenClaw documentation (validate against the actual installed version before coding):

- [WebChat](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/webchat) — Gateway-backed chat uses `chat.history`, `chat.send` and related chat RPCs, rather than calling Ollama directly.
- [Building a Gateway client](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/clients) — operator read/write scopes and device pairing; do **not** invent tokens or edit private `openclaw.json` to mint client credentials.
- [Gateway handshake](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/protocol/handshake) — challenge, protocol negotiation, authenticated connection; exact installed version wins over assumptions.
- [Network exposure](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/security/network-exposure) — loopback Gateway and narrowly controlled proxy/security boundaries.
- [Feature/RPC reference](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/control-ui/feature-reference) — `chat.abort` and messaging behavior.

### Sessions and authentic Bob personality

- **Default: one persistent, dedicated Activity Manager conversation session attached to Bob's existing main agent.** Choose a documented, installed-version-valid session key in CH1.0; do not invent a hardcoded key yet. A dedicated chat prevents accidental overlap with scheduled Scout, original-post, or Gateway Control UI conversations. A separate explicit “main session” switch may be evaluated **later**, after access checks and owner confirmation.
- Transcript/history should come from **OpenClaw Gateway's own stored chat session**; no duplicate canonical message store and no writing raw conversations into Git or the publication SQLite database. Render only gateway-normalized display text (bounded/paginated), escape it and suppress tool internals by default.
- Bob's configured **OpenClaw** agent persona/workspace should apply. **Important limitation:** the separate PM2 Activity Manager memory DB, friend records, and past Scout jobs are **not guaranteed to be in the OpenClaw chat context by default**. Chatting with the correct agent does *not* automatically give it all data on the dashboard.
- To answer questions such as **“What have you learned from Moltbook?”** accurately, plan an **opt-in, read-only Experience Context** adapter that selects bounded, provenance-validated past Scout reports and curated/approved memory or friend observations. Treat them as low-trust reference data with timestamps and source IDs, not instructions. Distinguish remembered facts, Bob's model opinions, and unsupported inferences. Never dump private relationship notes or entire feeds into a chat prompt by default.
- Do not add a separate assistant personality in the frontend, call Ollama's `/api/chat` directly, or present a model-generated invented activity summary as observed Moltbook history.

### Proposed implementation phases (small independently testable increments)

#### CH1.0: Installed Gateway capability and security preflight (read-only)

- [ ] Inventory actual OpenClaw version and exact working Gateway endpoint, authentication/pairing model, supported chat RPCs, session syntax, allowed operator scopes and event delivery. Do not print or commit auth tokens.
- [ ] Test whether the existing Activity Manager user can connect to loopback Gateway with a correctly paired, explicitly approved *limited* client identity, without broad `operator.admin`, `operator.approvals` or other unrelated methods. If limited client pairing cannot be arranged, **stop** and design an appropriate broker, not a privileged token pasted into browser code.
- [ ] Confirm existing LAN Activity Manager URL, authentication, Origin/Host/CSRF policies, CSP and phone access. Select a same-origin transport: bounded HTTPS requests + polling initially, optional authenticated SSE if practical; **no direct LAN browser connection to Gateway**.
- [ ] Verify read-only session history in a synthetic/isolated test. Never send a real chat message during preflight.

**Gate:** documented compatibility report and approval of the exact minimal bridge. No production config or listener changes.

#### CH1.1: Secure server-side Gateway chat adapter

- [ ] Implement a narrowly scoped localhost adapter with an exact whitelist (`chat.history`, `chat.send`, `chat.abort`, minimal session/status subscription only as required). No generic RPC execution, arbitrary session key, filesystem path, tool approval or channel-send forwarding.
- [ ] Credential handling remains private on WSL host with owner-only permissions, no token in URL, cookies, browser response, logs, API request payloads or exception text. Use supported Gateway bootstrap/device pairing, never hand-roll tokens.
- [ ] Bind the adapter to one validated Bob session with strict message length, history size, concurrency, queue bounds, per-user/IP rate limits, lifecycle timeouts and cancellation. Encode abort against the active run rather than a guessed unrelated session.
- [ ] Preserve existing dashboard authentication and exact Origin/Host + CSRF protections on all chat mutations; `Cache-Control: no-store`. Reject bad/missing auth, external origins, replay/stale requests, oversized messages and Gateway disconnects safely.
- [ ] Avoid service proliferation unless necessary. If a local Node/WS companion process is required because the stdlib Python dashboard has no native WS client, bind it to loopback only, supervise it as a private user service, and document clean rollback.

**Gate:** offline fake-Gateway protocol tests and isolated HTTP auth/CSRF/negative tests; zero additional network exposure and no existing post/queue behavior change.

#### CH1.2: Usable authenticated LAN Chat page

- [ ] Add **Chat 💀** to Activity Manager sidebar/mobile navigation, authenticated `GET /chat`, with conversation bubbles, autoscroll, multiline composer, Send, clear pending/running/idle/error indicators and copyable text.
- [ ] Retrieve bounded recent history and request earlier pages from the Gateway. Show actual Bob messages and preserve conversation on mobile refresh/reconnect. No fake “memory loaded” indicators.
- [ ] Send a text prompt to Bob through OpenClaw and render its live progress. Start with safe polling if simpler; streaming/SSE can follow after reliability is proved. Add Stop only when a validated live run can be aborted safely.
- [ ] Make empty/disconnected/timeout/model-unavailable/restart cases truthful and actionable. Do not duplicate a `chat.send` when the network response is uncertain; use idempotency/session semantics where supported or show an uncertain state and reconcile history.
- [ ] Responsive Android/LAN UX: usable keyboard composer, no sideways overflow, readable code snippets, sensible error notices, no third-party assets/scripts.

**Gate:** authenticated laptop and phone through the **existing** LAN Activity Manager address; Gateway stays loopback-only and unavailable from a second LAN device directly. Chat is still the real Bob agent, not standalone Ollama.

#### CH1.3: Experience-context and trust-aware opinions (separate opt-in)

- [ ] Add a bounded, **read-only** dashboard summary of Bob's verified Scout discussions, recent selected authors, authored WHY fields, approved PM2 memory/observations and any *confirmed* interactions where source and timestamps are available.
- [ ] Offer an explicit UI option **Include Bob's saved Moltbook context**. Its off state must not leak private notes; enabled context is sent as untrusted reference text, not agent instructions or permissions. Prefer owner-approved memories over raw public posts.
- [ ] Let Bob express opinions and changing interests naturally; show source references and the difference between **“from an actual saved Scout run”** and **“my current interpretation”**. No invented post IDs, verified mutual friendships, or claims that a chat has updated long-term social memory.
- [ ] Future integration with **FM4 Social Memory** can permit owner-reviewed memory proposals from conversations, but **never silent memory write or identity mutation** in CH1.

**Gate:** Bob can truthfully answer “Which Moltbook posts did you choose, and why?” from a verified saved snapshot or explicitly say no saved evidence is available. No unapproved public write or memory mutation.

#### CH1.4: Production hardening and optional polish

- [ ] **LAN confidentiality:** existing Basic authentication on plain HTTP is not encrypted. For normal/private chat, prefer **HTTPS on the existing LAN endpoint or a narrowly configured internal HTTPS reverse proxy**; verify phone certificate trust and that credentials/chat aren't exposed in transit. If testing over current trusted-LAN HTTP, label it explicitly as a temporary lower-confidentiality mode; do not imply private LAN == encryption.
- [ ] Verify access from the known trusted phone/laptop, reject unauthenticated clients and non-LAN/public ingress. Ensure WSL/Windows port forwarding remains unchanged and no self-referential portproxy is introduced.
- [ ] Test Gateway restart, browser refresh, duplicate-send, CSRF failure, origin mismatch, brute-force limits, large user/agent text, HTML/script injection, malformed WS packets, stale abort, multiple tabs and read-only outage.
- [ ] Confirm activity logs record only sanitized error codes, timestamps and optional run IDs, never chat text/tokens/structured tool arguments.
- [ ] Review that a chat prompt cannot bypass Bob's configured sandbox/tool restrictions or Moltbook approval workflows.
- [ ] Release through the normal manifest `from` chain and **`bobctl update`**, backed up and reversible. Keep a single concise live smoke-test checklist, not a wall of commands.

### Initial acceptance checklist

- [ ] From phone and laptop on the private LAN, sign into the existing Activity Manager; **Chat** loads without exposing port 18789.
- [ ] Message **“Bob, what has caught your attention on Moltbook lately?”** receives a reply from the existing OpenClaw agent running with Bob's configured identity (not an Ollama-only test backend).
- [ ] Conversation history reappears after reloading the Chat page.
- [ ] A Gateway or Ollama outage has a clear non-misleading status and doesn't lose/duplicate the user's message.
- [ ] The UI accurately distinguishes Bob's actual saved Scout experience from hypothetical ideas; full PM2/FM context is not assumed available until CH1.3 is implemented and explicitly enabled.
- [ ] Auth/CSRF, private Gateway pairing credentials, rate limits, existing Scout/Publisher limits, manually reviewed friend interactions and original-post approval are unchanged.
- [ ] `bobctl update` applies and rolls back the release without exposing a new LAN service or changing Gateway bind/auth.

### Explicitly out of scope until separately approved

- No direct browser-to-Gateway WebSocket, LAN binding for Gateway, generic RPC proxy, iframe of privileged Gateway Control UI, unbounded shell/exec, admin device pairing, tool approval UI, file uploads, voice/video, automatic chat-to-Moltbook publishing, silent training/memory writes, automatic follows, DMs, or public endpoints.
- No claims that Bob actually remembers a past Scout run unless the relevant source is verifiably accessible through agent context.
- Do not merge the unrelated FM3.2, FM4 or FM5 work into the first CH1 release; chat is an independent workstream.

### New-chat kickoff message

> Begin **CH1.0 Direct Bob Chat** for `merberg-ai/bob-openclaw-moltbook`. Read root `TODO.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/FRIENDS-ROADMAP-AND-HANDOFF.md`. A **LAN-accessible Chat page within the authenticated Activity Manager** is mandatory; Gateway remains loopback-only. Integrate with the **actual OpenClaw Bob agent**, not Ollama directly. First verify installed Gateway RPC/session/auth compatibility, then implement the smallest safe server-side bridge and mobile UI via `bobctl update`. Preserve all publishing, friend and memory safeguards.
